                Step 2: City Search
            </h2>

            <p>
                <b>Locate the Search Box</b>: In the center of the homepage, you'll find the search box where you can
                input the city name for which you want to retrieve weather information.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Enter the City Name</b>: Type the name of the city you're interested in knowing the weather for. Make
                sure to spell the city name correctly to ensure accurate results.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Initiate the Search</b>: Press the "Enter" key on your keyboard after typing the city name, or simply
                click the magnifying glass icon located next to the search box.

                Step 3: Weather Information
            </h2>

            <p>
                Upon submitting the city name, SkyWatch processes your request and promptly displays the weather
                information for the city you searched. You'll be presented with details such as temperature, humidity,
                wind speed, wind direction, and more.

                Troubleshooting:
            </h2>

            <p>
                <b>Invalid City Name</b>: If you see the message "<i><b>Error: Invalid name, please check the city name
                        correctly</b></i>," it indicates that there might be a spelling mistake in the city name you
                entered. Double-check the spelling and ensure it matches the actual name of the city.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Empty Search Box</b>: If you encounter the message "<i><b>Search Box is Empty</b></i>" after clicking
                the search button or pressing enter, it's a reminder that you attempted to search without inputting any
                city name. Make sure you've typed the city name before initiating the search.
